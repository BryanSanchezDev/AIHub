## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AIHub
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the client:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies for the server:
   ```
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the client:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

The client application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

You can modify the components in the `client/src/components` directory to build out your application. The server can be extended by adding new routes in the `server/src/routes` directory.
